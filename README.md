Every time before you start a new project you always anticipate all the fun parts of the development but you have to take yourself through the initial setup, site layout, code organization, libraries, etc. So I don't have to repeat that work many times in the future I made a project seed for front-end development. Built in Angular2 the application implements material design for the UI and auth0 for authentication.
